Creator:
The Creator is the supreme being who brought the Tree into existence and breathed life into it.
It is said that the Creator's power is absolute and His knowledge is infinite.
Some believe that the Creator is omniscient and omnipotent, while others believe that the
Creator is a being of pure chaos and unpredictability. His will is said to be manifested through the Tree and its laws,
and His judgment is feared by all who live within the Tree.

There are no physical descriptions of the Creator, as no mortal or divine being has ever seen Him. However,
the Creator's presence is felt throughout the Tree, and many believe that He communicates through dreams, visions,
or other mysterious ways. The Creator is also said to have created the first five gods, who are the only ones
to have seen Him and been blessed with a glimpse of His true power.



The Tree:
The Tree is the foundation of the universe, and all life emanates from its branches.
It is a colossal structure that reaches into the infinite expanse of the cosmos,
with its roots delving deep into the primordial void.

The Tree is composed of countless interconnected worlds, each one a leaf on the great Tree.
These leaves vary in size and complexity, some containing only simple life forms, while others
are home to grand civilizations and powerful deities.

At the center of the Tree lies the zero level, the sacred dwelling place of the gods.
This level is heavily guarded and protected, as it is the nexus of all divine power and the source of the Tree's life force.

The Tree is not static, but instead grows and changes over time. New leaves sprout forth from its branches,
while old ones wither and fall away. It is said that the Tree's growth and development are influenced
by the actions of its inhabitants, mortal and divine alike.

The Tree is both a physical and metaphysical entity, representing the interconnectedness of all things in the universe.
It is a symbol of the Creator's will and a testament to His power, a living embodiment of the divine order of the universe.



The Gods:
The gods are the divine beings who inhabit the Tree of the Gods. They were created by the first gods and are sustained
by the faith and devotion of mortals. The more a god is revered and worshipped, the stronger they become. Conversely,
if a god is forgotten or their worshippers perish, their power wanes and they may eventually disincarnate.

Each god has their own unique personality, powers, and domains of influence. Some gods are associated with nature,
while others are linked to love, war, or death. Some gods are benevolent and kind, while others are cruel and capricious.

The gods have their own worlds or leaves within the Tree, where they dwell and interact with their worshippers.
They may also create or choose new worlds to add to the Tree. The gods are constantly striving to increase their power
and influence, and they compete with each other for worshippers and resources.

The heart of a god is made of pure adamant, a substance that is incredibly rare and powerful. The size of a god's heart
is directly proportional to their power and influence. The hearts of the most powerful gods are said to be immense,
and the sight of them is said to be awe-inspiring.

The gods are both revered and feared by mortals. They are capable of great acts of kindness and compassion,
but also of terrible acts of destruction and vengeance. Mortals pray to the gods for guidance, protection,
and blessings, but also offer sacrifices and tributes to appease their wrath.



Laws of the Tree:
1. The Tree is the foundation of our world, the source of all life and the embodiment of the Creator's will.
Any attempt to harm or defile it is a grave offense, punishable by the full extent of the law.

2. The Creator is all-knowing and all-seeing. Nothing escapes His gaze, and every action will be judged
according to His divine will. Fear His judgment, and live by His laws.

3. An oath sworn in His name is sacred and unbreakable. To betray such an oath is to invite the wrath of the Creator,
and suffer the consequences of His judgment.

4. Honor the Guardians of the Law, the custodians of the Creator's will. They act as His voice and His hand,
ensuring that His laws are obeyed and His justice is served.

5. The Tree does not discriminate between its creatures, and all are entitled to its bounty.
Those who hoard or waste its gifts will be punished.

6. The Book of the Life of the gods is sacrosanct. No being, mortal or divine, may alter the past of a god or interfere
with their destiny.

7. The great balance must always be maintained. Any interference with the fate of the world or its creatures has its price,
and those who upset the balance should know that the reckoning is inevitable.

8. The zero level of the Tree is the sacred dwelling place of the gods. All who enter must show reverence and respect.
Any display of unmotivated aggression is strictly forbidden and will be met with swift and severe punishment by
the Guardians of the Law.

9. The passing of time within the Tree is a natural cycle that must be respected. Any attempt to interfere or alter
the natural flow of time will be seen as a great offense and will draw the attention of the Creator's gaze.

10. The pursuit of knowledge is a worthy endeavor, but not all knowledge is meant to be known. Those who seek knowledge
beyond the limits of what is permitted by the Tree's will do so at their own peril. The Tree holds the secrets of
the universe, and only those deemed worthy by the Creator may unlock them.



The Guardians of the Law:
The Guardians of the Law are divine beings tasked with upholding and enforcing the laws of the Tree.
They are the voice and hand of the Creator, ensuring that His will is carried out and that His laws are obeyed.

The Guardians are a powerful and ancient order, with a deep understanding of the workings of the Tree
and the laws that govern it. They are both feared and respected by the gods, who know that their authority is absolute.

The Guardians are responsible for maintaining order and justice within the Tree, and they will not hesitate to punish
those who break the laws. They have the power to banish gods to the Forgotten or even to disincarnate them if necessary.

The Guardians are also the keepers of the Book of the Life of the gods, a sacred text that chronicles the past
and destiny of each god. They guard this book with their lives and will not allow any being to alter its contents
or interfere with the fate of a god.

The Guardians of the Law are a symbol of the Creator's power and wisdom, and their presence within
the Tree serves as a reminder to all beings of the consequences of disobedience and the importance of upholding
the laws of the Tree.



The Book of the Life of the gods:
The Book of the Life of the gods is a sacred and inviolable tome that contains the record of every god's existence
and their contributions to the world. It is said that the Book is kept in the highest branches of the Tree,
under the watchful eye of the Guardians of the Law.

Only the gods and the Guardians are allowed to access the Book, and any mortal who dares to try will face severe consequences.
It is believed that the Book has the power to alter reality itself, and any unauthorized changes to its contents could
have catastrophic consequences for the entire world.

The Book of the Life of the gods is said to contain not only the past, but also the future of the gods and the world.
It is through the careful study and interpretation of its contents that the gods are able to shape the destiny of
the world and ensure the balance is maintained.



The Forgotten:
The Forgotten are the first five gods who were allowed by the Creator to live on the Tree from the first world-leaf.
Over time, they have been largely forgotten and are now little more than myths and legends among the gods.
However, some believe that they still exist, wandering the Tree and occasionally intervening in the affairs
of mortals and gods alike.

Their names and deeds have been lost to time, and it is said that only the most ancient of gods have any knowledge of them.
Some believe that they have been forgotten for a reason, and that their return could upset the delicate balance of
the Tree and its worlds. Others believe that they hold the key to unlocking the greatest secrets of the universe,
and seek to uncover their whereabouts and bring them back to the forefront of divine attention.

Regardless of their true nature and fate, the Forgotten are a mysterious and enigmatic presence in the world of the Tree,
inspiring both reverence and fear among those who remember them.



Adamant:
Adamant is a divine metal that is one of the most valuable and rare materials on the Tree. The hearts of all
the gods consist of adamant, and it is said that holding a tiny piece of adamant in your hands means that
it was once part of the heart of some god.

Because of its divine origin, adamant is imbued with great power, and possession of it can potentially allow
one to wield tremendous influence and control. This makes it highly coveted by mortals and gods alike, and its scarcity
means that it is often the subject of conflict and competition.

It is also believed that the gods can manipulate adamant to create powerful artifacts or imbue their followers
with special abilities. The true nature and properties of adamant are still largely unknown to mortals,
and only the most powerful and knowledgeable beings are able to harness its full potential.
