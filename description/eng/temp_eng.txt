Brief plot:
    "Godfall: Rise of the Forgotten":

    The player takes on the role of a forgotten god who has lost their memory and abilities.

    The player's goal is to reach the top of the Tree of Gods and find the Tree Maker to uncover the truth about their

    Along the way, the player will encounter various gods, heroes, and creatures who can assist them in their journey.

    The game world consists of 80 levels, each with 20 zones that the player must traverse to progress further up the tree.

    Each zone will present unique challenges and events, including resource nodes for mining and gathering.

    The player will need to develop their character by earning experience points, leveling up, and acquiring new abilities
    and skills.

    The gods in the game each possess a sphere of influence that the player can gain access to by completing quests or
    defeating bosses.

    The storyline is dynamic and will change based on the player's choices and actions, culminating in multiple possible
    endings depending on the player's decisions.

    The game will feature turn-based combat, crafting, and randomized loot drops from enemies.

Laws of the Tree:
    1. This Tree is the foundation of our world, the source of all life and the embodiment of the Creator's will.
    Any attempt to harm or defile it is a grave offense, punishable by the full extent of the law.

    2. The Creator is all-knowing and all-seeing. Nothing escapes His gaze, and every action will be judged according
    to His divine will. Fear His judgment, and live by His laws.

    3. An oath sworn in His name is sacred and unbreakable. To betray such an oath is to invite the wrath of the Creator,
    and suffer the consequences of His judgment.

    4. Honor the Guardians of the Law, the custodians of the Creator's will. They act as His voice and His hand,
    ensuring that His laws are obeyed and His justice is served.

    5. The Tree does not discriminate between its creatures, and all are entitled to its bounty.
    Those who hoard or waste its gifts will be punished.

    6. The Book of the Life of the gods is sacrosanct. No being, mortal or divine, may alter the past of a god
    or interfere with their destiny.

    7. The great balance must always be maintained. Any interference with the fate of the world or its creatures
    has its price, and those who upset the balance should know that the reckoning is inevitable.

    8.  The zero level of the Tree is the sacred dwelling place of the gods. All who enter must show reverence and respect.
    Any display of unmotivated aggression is strictly forbidden and will be met with swift and severe punishment
    by the Guardians of the Law.

    9. The passing of time within the Tree is a natural cycle that must be respected. Any attempt to interfere
    or alter the natural flow of time will be seen as a great offense and will draw the attention of the Creator's gaze.

    10. The pursuit of knowledge is a worthy endeavor, but not all knowledge is meant to be known.
    Those who seek knowledge beyond the limits of what is permitted by the Tree's will do so at their own peril.
    The Tree holds the secrets of the universe, and only those deemed worthy by the Creator may unlock them.
