We are writing a story for the universe of the computer game "Godfall: Rise of the Forgotten".
At the moment there are several elements of this world:


Creator:
The Creator is the supreme being in the mythology of the Tree of Worlds. The origin of the Creator is unknown,
and the gods and mortals alike believe that it is beyond the understanding of their finite minds.
It is said that the Creator gave birth to the Tree of Worlds from the sprout of the Tree and created the first world-leaf.

The Creator is omniscient and all-seeing, and nothing escapes His sight. The gods and mortals believe that
the Creator has the power to control the fate of all beings on the Tree, and that His will is absolute.

In the early days of the Tree, the Creator was known to intervene in the affairs of the gods and the inhabitants
of the worlds-leaves, but over time, He stopped interfering and allowed them to grow and develop on their own.

The first gods were created by the faith of the intelligent beings of the first world-leaf, and the Creator liked them.
He brought them closer to Him, allowed them to live on the Tree of Worlds, create their own worlds-leaves,
and shared with them some of His knowledge and strength. The first five gods were the most favored of the Creator,
and they were said to have reached the heights of the Creator and left the Tree to grow Their Tree of Worlds.

The Creator is revered and feared by the gods and mortals alike, and any action that can damage the Tree of Worlds
is considered the most terrible attack and is punished accordingly. The gods and mortals believe that the Creator's
judgment is final and that His laws must be followed without question.



The Shadows of the Creator:
The Shadows of the Creator are mysterious entities that are said to embody the aspects of the Creator's power and will.
There are two Shadows, known as the Shadow of Order and the Shadow of Chaos.

The Shadow of Order is said to be a being of pure logic and reason, embodying the Creator's desire for structure and control.
It is said to be a creature of light, radiating a cold and calculating energy. Some believe that the Shadow of Order
has the ability to manipulate reality itself, bending it to its will and imposing its own sense of order on the world.

The Shadow of Chaos, on the other hand, is said to be a being of pure passion and unpredictability,
embodying the Creator's desire for creativity and change. It is said to be a creature of darkness,
with a wild and untamed energy. Some believe that the Shadow of Chaos has the ability to sow discord
and chaos wherever it goes, unleashing unpredictable and dangerous energies.

Despite their differences, the Shadows are said to be bound together in an eternal dance, each influencing and shaping the other.
Some even believe that the Shadows are the true architects of the Tree of Worlds, and that their influence can be felt
in every aspect of creation. However, little is truly known about the Shadows, and their true nature and purpose
remain shrouded in mystery.



The Tree of Worlds:
The Tree of Worlds is a vast, mythical tree that is said to be the source of all life in the universe.
It is the embodiment of the will of the Creator and serves as the foundation of the world and all its realms.

According to legend, the Creator gave birth to the Tree from a sprout, and created the first world-sheet on its branches.
The first gods were allowed to live on the Tree, and the Creator wrote the laws that must be observed by all
beings who stepped on the Tree. As time passed, the Tree continued to grow, giving rise to new levels of branches
and leaf worlds, reaching fifty-two levels in its crown and twenty-nine levels in its roots.

The zero level of the Tree is a sacred dwelling place of the gods, where young gods must learn the laws of the Tree
and themselves, and learn how to use their power. The passage of time within the Tree is a natural cycle
that must be respected, and any attempt to interfere or change the natural flow of time will be perceived as a great insult.

The Tree of Worlds is considered to be one of the most important symbols of the universe, representing
the interconnectedness of all life and the divine will that governs it. Its importance is reflected in
the laws that have been created to protect it, and any action or inaction that can damage the Tree is considered
the most terrible attack and is punished accordingly.


The Great Chaos:
The Great Chaos is a primordial force that exists outside the Tree of Worlds and the order it represents.
It is the antithesis of the Creator and seeks to destroy the Tree and all that it stands for.

According to legend, the Chaos was born from the primordial void that existed before the Tree of Worlds.
It is said that the Chaos is the raw essence of entropy, destruction, and change. It seeks to tear down order
and structure wherever it finds it, and to return everything to a state of primordial chaos.

In the early days of the Tree, the Chaos was held at bay by the power of the Creator and the order of the Tree.
But over time, beings who were drawn to chaos and destruction emerged from the Tree's many branches and worlds.
They became known as Chaosites, and they began to worship the Great Chaos as a god.

The Chaosites sought to spread chaos and destruction throughout the Tree, and they waged war against the gods
who sought to maintain order. The chaos they unleashed threatened to destroy the Tree itself, and it was
only through the combined efforts of the gods that the Chaosites were eventually defeated.

Today, the Great Chaos remains a potent force in the universe, always seeking to undermine the order of
the Tree and to return everything to a state of primordial chaos. The gods remain ever vigilant against its influence,
and they continue to work to maintain the balance and order of the Tree.



The Gods:
In the mythology of many cultures, gods are divine beings who possess supernatural powers and are worshiped by humans.
In the context of the Tree of Worlds, the gods are powerful beings who reside on the Tree and are responsible for
the creation and maintenance of the leaf worlds.

According to the mythology of the Tree, the first gods were created by the Creator and were given the task of living
on the Tree and carrying out His will. As time passed, more and more gods were created, and each was given
a specific task or domain to oversee.

The gods of the Tree are diverse and have different personalities and abilities. Some are benevolent and kind,
while others are more mischievous or malevolent. However, all of the gods are bound by the laws of the Tree and
must act in accordance with the will of the Creator.

Throughout the history of the Tree, the gods have played a significant role in shaping the destiny of the leaf worlds.
Some have acted as protectors or guides, while others have been responsible for great catastrophes or wars.
Despite their power and influence, however, the gods are not immortal and can be killed or destroyed by other gods
or powerful beings.

The mythology of the gods on the Tree of Worlds is complex and multifaceted, with different cultures and belief
systems having their own unique interpretations of the gods and their roles. Nevertheless, they remain an integral
part of the Tree's cosmology and continue to be a source of fascination and inspiration for many.



The First Five (Forgotten):
The First Five, also known as the Forgotten, were the earliest and most powerful gods to exist in the Tree of Worlds.
Their identities and deeds have been lost to time, and even their existence is now questioned by some.
According to legend, they were present during the creation of the Tree and were instrumental in establishing
the laws and order that govern the gods and the Tree.

Over time, however, the First Five disappeared and ceased to appear among the other gods, leading many to speculate
about their fate. Some believe that they withdrew to a higher plane of existence, while others think they perished
in some great conflict. Regardless of what happened to them, the legacy of the First Five lives on in the reverence
shown to them by the other gods and in the belief that their power and wisdom surpassed that of all who followed.



Chaos Adepts (Chaosites):
Chaos Adepts, also known as Chaosites, are beings who have chosen to follow the path of Chaos.
They are individuals who reject order and seek to bring about the destruction of the existing world
and the creation of a new one. Chaosites believe that change is necessary for growth and progress and
that chaos is a necessary force for this change to occur.

The history of Chaosites is intertwined with the history of the Tree of Worlds. According to legend,
the First Five were the first gods to appear on the Tree, and their disappearance marked the beginning of Chaosites' emergence.
The absence of the First Five created a power vacuum, which Chaosites sought to fill by advocating for
the destruction of the current order and the establishment of a new one.

Chaosites have been known to use various methods to achieve their goals, including manipulation,
deception, and even violence. Their ultimate aim is to bring about a world free from the constraints of order and rules,
where chaos reigns supreme. However, their actions often bring about destruction and suffering, and they
are viewed with suspicion and fear by many other beings on the Tree.



Creatures of Chaos:
Creatures of Chaos are beings that dwell in the lower levels of the roots of the Tree of Worlds,
beyond the reach of the Keepers of the Law. They are chaotic and unpredictable in nature, and their existence
is shrouded in mystery and legends.

According to some tales, the Creatures of Chaos were the first beings to emerge from the Great Chaos,
before the gods and mortals came to be. They are said to be the remnants of the chaotic energies that permeate the universe,
given form and consciousness by the will of the Great Chaos.

Others believe that they were created by the gods as a test of their power and wisdom, or as a punishment
for mortals who defied their will. Whatever their origin, the Creatures of Chaos are feared and respected by many,
and their power and influence are not to be underestimated.

There are many different kinds of Creatures of Chaos, each with their own abilities and characteristics.
Some are mindless and animalistic, while others are cunning and intelligent. Some can take on multiple forms,
while others are limited to a single form. Many of them possess great magical powers, and are capable
of unleashing devastating spells and curses upon their enemies.

Due to their chaotic nature, the Creatures of Chaos are often seen as a threat to the stability and order of the Tree of Worlds.
The Keepers of the Law are tasked with keeping them in check, but their power and influence are limited in the
lower levels of the roots of the Tree. As a result, many mortals and even some gods avoid venturing too deep into the roots,
for fear of encountering these unpredictable and dangerous beings.



Laws of the Tree:
The Laws of the Tree of Worlds are the set of rules that govern the behavior and interactions of all beings in the Tree,
from the gods to the mortal creatures that dwell in its leaf worlds. These laws were written by the Creator and must be
obeyed by all who step on the Tree, or face the consequences of their actions.

The laws cover a wide range of topics, including the sacredness of the Tree, the inviolability of oaths made in
the Creator's name, the importance of maintaining balance and order in the world, and the sanctity of
the zero level of the Tree, which is the dwelling place of the gods.

The history of the Laws of the Tree of Worlds is closely tied to the history of the Tree itself.
As the Tree grew and developed, new laws were added to govern new situations and challenges that arose.
The Keepers of the Law, who act as the voice and hand of the Creator, were tasked with enforcing these laws
and ensuring that justice was served.

Over time, some beings began to chafe under the strictures of the Laws, and some even sought to break them.
Chaos Adepts, for example, reject the laws of the Tree in favor of their own chaotic principles. However,
the Keepers of the Law have always been vigilant in their duty to uphold the laws and maintain order in
the Tree, and any who would seek to flout the laws do so at their own peril.

The Lows:
1. The Tree of Worlds is the foundation of our world, the source of all life, and the embodiment of the will of the Creator.
Any action or inaction that can damage the Tree is a terrible offense and will be punished accordingly.

2. The Creator is all-knowing and all-seeing. Do not attract His attention in vain, for you risk arousing His curiosity.

3. Oaths made in the name of the Creator are sacred and inviolable. To break such an oath is to invite the wrath of
the Creator and face His judgment.

4. Honor the Keepers of the Law, who act as the voice and hand of the Creator, ensuring that His laws are upheld
and justice is served.

5. The Tree makes no distinctions between its beings, and all are entitled to its bounty. Appreciate
the generosity of the Tree.

6. The Book of the Life of the Gods is sacred. No being, mortal or divine, can change a god's past or interfere
with their destiny.

7. A great balance must be maintained. Any interference with the fate of the world or its creatures has its price,
and those who upset the balance will face retribution.

8. The zero level of the Tree is the sacred dwelling place of the gods. All who enter must show deference and respect.
Any manifestation of unmotivated aggression is strictly prohibited and punished immediately and severely.

9. The passage of time within the Tree is a natural cycle that must be respected. Any attempt to interfere or
change the natural flow of time will be perceived as a great insult and will attract the Creator's attention.

10. The pursuit of knowledge is a worthy occupation, but not all knowledge is meant to be known.
Those who seek knowledge beyond what is permitted by the will of the Tree do so at their own peril and risk.
The Tree keeps secrets of the universe, and only those deemed worthy by the Creator can unlock them.



The Keepers of the Law:
The Keepers of the Law are a group of powerful beings who act as enforcers of the laws of the Tree of Worlds,
serving as the voice and hand of the Creator. They ensure that all beings who inhabit the Tree follow the
laws set forth by the Creator and punish those who violate them.

The history of the Keepers of the Law is closely tied to the creation of the Tree and the emergence of the first gods.
As the Tree began to grow and new levels and leaf worlds appeared, the Creator saw the need to establish laws to
maintain order and prevent chaos.

The Creator selected a group of powerful beings from among the gods and granted them the authority to enforce His laws.
These beings became known as the Keepers of the Law and were given the responsibility to maintain order and balance
within the Tree.

Over time, the Keepers of the Law became a powerful force within the Tree, feared and respected by all who inhabited it.
They developed their own hierarchy and methods of enforcement, and their word became law in all matters relating
to the Tree.

Today, the Keepers of the Law continue to serve as guardians of the Tree, ensuring that the laws of the Creator
are upheld and that the balance of the universe is maintained. Their power and authority are unmatched,
and their judgment is final.



The Book of the Life of the gods:
The Book of the Life of the Gods is a sacred text that contains the recorded history and destiny
of every god that has ever existed. It is said that the book is written by the Creator himself and
kept under the care of the Keepers of the Law. The book is said to contain not only the past and future of the gods,
but also their present state, thoughts, and emotions.

According to the legends, the Book of the Life of the Gods has always existed, and it is said to be one of the oldest
and most powerful artifacts in the Tree of Worlds. Its existence is known to all gods, but only a select few have ever
been allowed to read its pages. It is said that reading the book is a life-changing experience, and those
who are deemed worthy by the Keepers of the Law are granted access to it.

The book has been the subject of many disputes and conflicts between the gods throughout history.
Some have sought to alter their destiny, while others have tried to use the book to gain power and influence.
However, the Keepers of the Law are fiercely protective of the book and will go to great lengths to ensure its safety
and the integrity of its contents.

In summary, the Book of the Life of the Gods is a powerful and mysterious artifact that plays a significant
role in the mythology of the Tree of Worlds. Its history and origins are shrouded in mystery, but it is revered
and respected by all who know of its existence.



The Heart of God:
The Heart of God is the essence of a god's being, containing their soul and serving as the primary vessel for their
"Faith Points." The size and weight of a god's heart are directly proportional to their level of power and exaltation.
The smallest hearts belong to the lowest-ranked gods, weighing only a few grams, while the hearts of the most powerful
gods can weigh hundreds of grams.

The destruction of a god's heart is the ultimate form of defeat, as it means the complete annihilation of their being.
It is said that even the most ancient and powerful gods fear for the safety of their hearts, as they know that any
attack aimed at it could spell their doom.

Despite their importance, the exact nature and properties of the Heart of God are still largely unknown,
even to the gods themselves. Many myths and legends surround it, and it is considered one of the most sacred
and mysterious objects in all of creation.

As a result, the Heart of God is heavily guarded and fiercely protected, with only the most trusted and loyal
servants of a god allowed access to it. Some gods have been known to create powerful artifacts to protect their
hearts, while others rely on their own strength and cunning to keep them safe.



Adamant:
Adamant is a divine metal that is one of the most valuable and rare materials on the Tree. The hearts of all
the gods consist of adamant, and it is said that holding a tiny piece of adamant in your hands means that
it was once part of the heart of some god.

Because of its divine origin, adamant is imbued with great power, and possession of it can potentially allow
one to wield tremendous influence and control. This makes it highly coveted by mortals and gods alike, and its scarcity
means that it is often the subject of conflict and competition.

It is also believed that the gods can manipulate adamant to create powerful artifacts or imbue their followers
with special abilities. The true nature and properties of adamant are still largely unknown to mortals,
and only the most powerful and knowledgeable beings are able to harness its full potential.



Points of Faith:
Points of Faith, also known simply as Faith, are a universal source of power for the gods.
They can receive, save, and transform these points into material values, miracles, and deeds.
The more complex the object or deed, the more faith points are needed.

Faith points can be obtained from various sources, including the god's followers, higher entities
of the Tree, defeated gods and creatures, and as rewards or gifts from other gods. The main repository
of a god's Faith is their adamant heart, which can store varying amounts depending on its size.

While there are artifacts that can store faith points, they are expensive and rare. As a result,
the most significant source of Faith for a god is their followers. Thus, many gods invest in
gaining and maintaining a large and devoted flock.

The exact nature and properties of Faith points are not fully understood by mortals,
and only the most powerful and knowledgeable beings can harness their full potential.
However, it is known that Faith is a potent force that can be used for both good and ill.
Therefore, many beings on the Tree covet it and will stop at nothing to obtain it.



The personal halls of a God:
The personal halls of a God are a manifestation of their divine power and wealth.
It is a place that transcends the boundaries of time and space, existing in a realm that is
solely created and maintained by the will of the God. The appearance and dimensions of each hall are unique,
tailored to the desires and tastes of its owner. Some may resemble grand palaces, while others may take the form
of humble abodes or even surreal landscapes.

The halls are protected by powerful enchantments and wards, preventing any unwanted intrusion or disturbance.
The treasures within the halls are guarded by powerful magical constructs or loyal servants, ensuring their safety and integrity.

Within the halls, the God can indulge in their creative pursuits, crafting powerful artifacts, experimenting
with new spells or simply reflecting on their existence. The halls also serve as a place of solitude,
where the God can retreat from the stresses and demands of the mortal realm and meditate on their divine purpose.

Only the wealthiest and most powerful of gods can afford to maintain personal halls, as the cost of creating
and maintaining such a place is immense. Nonetheless, it is considered a symbol of status and prestige among
the divine beings, and those who possess one are often held in high regard by their peers.
