Laws of the Tree:

1. This Tree is the foundation of our world, the source of all life and the embodiment of the Creator's will.
Any attempt to harm or defile it is a grave offense, punishable by the full extent of the law.

2. The Creator is all-knowing and all-seeing. Nothing escapes His gaze, and every action will be judged according
to His divine will. Fear His judgment, and live by His laws.

3. An oath sworn in His name is sacred and unbreakable. To betray such an oath is to invite the wrath of the Creator,
and suffer the consequences of His judgment.

4. Honor the Guardians of the Law, the custodians of the Creator's will. They act as His voice and His hand,
ensuring that His laws are obeyed and His justice is served.

5. The Tree does not discriminate between its creatures, and all are entitled to its bounty.
Those who hoard or waste its gifts will be punished.

6. The Book of the Life of the gods is sacrosanct. No being, mortal or divine, may alter the past of a god
or interfere with their destiny.

7. The great balance must always be maintained. Any interference with the fate of the world or its creatures
has its price, and those who upset the balance should know that the reckoning is inevitable.

I like these six laws and we will not change them anymore. Let's work out the remaining 4 laws.
Let's add a point about the Great Balance, i.e. any interference in the fate of the leaf world
and its creatures has its price, and if the deed is too great and God is too weak, then God must disincarnate.
It's a Great Balance to keep an eye on this.
